#
# Maximum number of allowed concurrent running and queued saga executions will be computed as:
#   (saga.threadpool.max + saga.threadpool.queue.capacity) / 2
#
# core must be greater than queue capacity in order to avoid potential deadlocks in saga-executions. Ideally
# core should be at least twice the value of queue capacity, preferably even more, that way new threads beyond
# core are started.
saga.threadpool.core=100
# max must be greater than the maximum intended capacity of concurrent saga-executions that can ever happen.
# max should generally be at least twice that of core to ensure good capacity when core and queue is saturated.
saga.threadpool.max=200
# keepalive should be some number of seconds more than 0 or 1. 60 is a reasonable default.
saga.threadpool.keepalive.seconds=60
# queue capacity must be less than core. Half the value of core is a reasonable start or something less than that.
saga.threadpool.queue.capacity=20
